<span class="s2">This project was bootstrapped with </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Create React App</span><span class="s1">](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)</span><span class="s2">.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Available Scripts</span>

<span class="s2">In the project directory, you can run</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">npm start</span><span class="s3">`</span>

<span class="s2">Runs the app in the development mode.</span><span class="s1">\</span>
<span class="s2">Open </span><span class="s1">[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) </span><span class="s2">to view it in the browser.</span>

<span class="s2">The page will reload if you make edits.</span><span class="s1">\</span>
<span class="s2">You will also see any lint errors in the console.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">npm test</span><span class="s3">`</span>

<span class="s2">Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.</span><span class="s1">\</span>
<span class="s2">See the section about </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">running tests</span><span class="s1">](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) </span><span class="s2">for more information.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">npm run build</span><span class="s3">`</span>

<span class="s2">Builds the app for production to the </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">build</span><span class="s3">` </span><span class="s2">folder.</span><span class="s1">\</span>
<span class="s2">It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</span>

<span class="s2">The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.</span><span class="s1">\</span>
<span class="s2">Your app is ready to be deployed</span><span class="s1">!</span>

<span class="s2">See the section about </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">deployment</span><span class="s1">](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) </span><span class="s2">for more information.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">npm run eject</span><span class="s3">`</span>

<span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">Note</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">this is a one-way operation. Once you </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">eject</span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">, you can’t go back</span><span class="s1">!**</span>

<span class="s2">If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">eject</span><span class="s3">` </span><span class="s2">at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</span>

<span class="s2">Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">eject</span><span class="s3">` </span><span class="s2">will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.</span>

<span class="s2">You don’t have to ever use </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">eject</span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s2">. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.</span>
